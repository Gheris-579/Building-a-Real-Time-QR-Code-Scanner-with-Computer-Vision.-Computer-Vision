# QR-Code-Scanner-with-Computer-Vision.-Computer-Vision
<p>QR codes are a ubiquitous form of information encoding used for everything from marketing to event registration. In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a real-time QR code scanner using computer vision techniques. We will use Python and OpenCV to capture and process live video from a webcam, detect and decode QR codes from the video stream, and display the decoded information on the screen.</p>
